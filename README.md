# Kathakriti: AI-Powered Folk Tale Animator

Kathakriti is a hackathon-ready web platform that transforms traditional oral or written folk tales into beautiful, interactive shadow puppet animations. It leverages modern frontend technologies and AI-powered services to create a seamless and magical storytelling experience, preserving cultural heritage in a new and engaging format.

This project was built to demonstrate a full user journey: from providing a story via voice, text, or file upload, to watching a dynamically generated, context-aware animated short story.

## ðŸš€ Core Features

* *Multi-Modal Story Input*: Users can provide their folk tales in three ways:
    * *Voice Recording*: An in-browser audio recorder to capture oral stories.
    * *File Upload*: Support for common audio formats (MP3, WAV, etc.).
    * *Text Input*: A dedicated text area for written stories.
* *AI-Simulated Poem Generation*: The user's original story is transformed into a poetic, folk-tale-style narrative with multiple, dynamically generated ending options based on the story's context.
* *Context-Aware Image Generation*: For each scene in the story, the platform intelligently extracts keywords from the user's original text and fetches relevant, high-quality images from the Unsplash API.
* *Dynamic Shadow Puppet Animation*: The fetched images are automatically styled with CSS filters to create a beautiful, consistent, fire-lit shadow puppet aesthetic. The scenes are then presented as an interactive, auto-playing animation with smooth transitions.
* *Interactive Player*: A fully-featured animation player with controls for play/pause, next/previous scene, restart, and volume adjustment, all wrapped in a responsive UI that works on both desktop and mobile.
